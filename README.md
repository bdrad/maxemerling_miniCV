# maxemerling_miniCV

data_collection contains code for reading dicom images, resizing them, and converting them to numpy arrays.

mini_cv contains code for constructing and training a model to classify mamogram images as "dense" or "not dense"
it also visualizes evaluations for the model.

Note that mini_cv was written originally on Google Colab, so they contain some code that only works on colab for reading in data files and such, but it should be easy to change for running locally.
